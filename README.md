The `react-context-3box` module wraps core 3Box functionality like logging in/out as a decentralized identity, reading/writing to personal storage, and commenting on threads.

Additionally the `react-context-3box` module includes state management for profiles, spaces, threads, verifications and read/write requests. Data returned from requests are saved in the `context` state to avoid requesting the same data multiple times.

# Features
React state management for 3Box decentralized identity and storage.

### Read/Write Request Log
By default 3Box (3box.js) provides `get` and `set` methods that can be run without user consent or knowledge once a user has logged in. To inform users of reading/writing to personal storage, the request log tracks read and write requests. The requests include metadata like access type (public or private) and whether to access the primary profile or a space.

User's can review incoming requests and decide to either ignore, confirm or reject the requests.

#### Add Request (addRequest)
Add a new read or write request to the `request` log.

#### Confirm Request (confirmRequest)
Confirm a request in the `request` log.

#### Reject Request (rejectRequest)
Reject a request in the the `request` log.


### Append Data
The 3Box (3box.js) library includes `set` and `setMultiple` methods to write data to personal storage. An `append` method has been added to now more easily add data to existing fields, without overwriting the previous values.
